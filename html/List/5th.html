            Software developers create the computer applications that allow
            users to do specific tasks and the underlying systems that run the
            devices or control networks. Software quality assurance analysts and
            testers design and execute software tests to identify problems and
            learn how the software works.

            Computer science is the most common degree that software developers
            choose when starting their career. When you get a degree in computer
            science, you will primarily study the exact skills that you will use
            on a daily basis as a developer.

            A software engineer is a person who applies the principles of
            software engineering to design, develop, maintain, test, and
            evaluate computer software. The term programmer is sometimes used as
            a synonym, but may also lack connotations of engineering education
            or skills.

          <p>
            Software engineering is the branch of computer science that deals
            with the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software
            applications. Software engineers apply engineering principles and
            knowledge of programming languages to build software solutions for
            end users.
